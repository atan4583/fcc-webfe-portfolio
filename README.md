## Project Deliverables Summary

### 1. [Build A Simon Game](https://github.com/atan4583/fcc-webfe-portfolio/tree/master/Build%20A%20Simon%20Game)
> * Buid a [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io) app that is functionally similar to this [SimonÂ® Game App](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/obYBjE).
>
>
> * Fulfill the following user stories:
>   - I am presented with a random series of button presses.
>   - Each time I input a series of button presses correctly, I see the same series of button presses but with an additional step.
>   - I hear a sound that corresponds to each button both when the series of button presses plays, and when I personally press a button.
>   - If I press the wrong button, I am notified that I have done so, and that series of button presses starts again to remind me of the pattern so I can try again.
>   - I can see how many steps are in the current series of button presses.
>   - If I want to restart, I can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step.
>   - I can play in strict mode where if I get a button press wrong, it notifies me that I have done so, and the game restarts at a new random series of button presses.
>   - I can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct. I am notified of my victory, then the game starts over.
